First full project completed independently to showcase what I learned in Bootcamp. I plan on keeping up with this application and refactoring to include an instant messenger between users.

## Backend for: 
a CRUD web app using Ruby, Vue.js, HTML/CSS that allows backpackers/hikers to track the gear they plan on bringing on adventures. The gear can be separated into categories, and uses a responsive graph that adjusts depending on the weight of each item, as well as the total pack weight.
